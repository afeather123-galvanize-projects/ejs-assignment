# EJS Assignment

We've been working with the gClasses (students/classes) database for a while and it's time to build a full app behind it!

Complete the following user stories:
- As a user, when I visit '/' I see a list of all the classes and a form to create a new class.
- As a user, when I submit the new class form I should see the new class displayed in the list.
- As a user, when I click on a class it takes me to the individual class page.
- As a user, when I view the class page I should see a list of all students in a class and a form to create a new student.
- As a user, when I submit the new student form I should see the new student displayed in the list.

STRETCH:
Add updating and deleting functionality for both students and classes.
